  <h2> General info </h2> 
    <!-- A normal picture of amy-->
    <img src="images/grumpydoggoedited.png">
    <p>Amy is a 5 year old doggo. She is mixed-breed between: Papillon (Kontinental toy spaniel), Maltese and Yorkshire terrier.
     She is a social dog who loves medium distance walks and a good family doggo. Partly allergy friendly because of her ties to the Maltese
     and Yorkshire terrier.</p>

  <p>Amy is a fluffy ball of joy. Her favourite past-times are: sleeping, barking at strangers and cuddling. She recently put on a 
     bit of weight, this does not concern her though as there is now more to love </p>

      <p>She does not like big doggos as this makes her insecure about her own size</p>
      <p>She barks at strangers, not because she is angry but because she wants to say hi</p>

  <h2> Where can i find a doggo which is also best? </h2>
  <!--A bunch of stock photo dogs-->
  <img src="images/stockphotodog.png">
  <p>There are many amazing doggos out there. There is a lot of responsibility and work to keep a doggo healthy and happy. 
   If you are ready for the resonsability there are many good doggos who need a home. I would recommend using the world wide web and
   finding local adoption centers and give a doggo a chance for a better life, and becoming a part of your life.
